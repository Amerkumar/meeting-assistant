# AI Meeting Assistant

## Big Picture

On device meeting assistant to extract meeting minutes,emphazing main points, schedule future meetings and setting reminders all in one utlizing the power of  machine learning using smartphone.

**You are supposed to do better work than writing minutes.**

### Idea 
---

Meetings are part of our life whether it is a gathering with our friends discussing great ideas or sitting professionally in a office meeting room to discuss the upcoming project or maybe getting a business advise from your mentor. It is just very difficult to listen and write at the same time. Even if we dedicate a separate person for the writing part and scheduling part. It is just too hard to jot down everything ultimately leaving some great idea. We, Humans are supposed to do better work than this. To address this, a mobile application powered by on-device machine learning can adress this everything. You just have to open the application and click the record button before your meeting. It will record your conversation and converts into text and separating into conversations of different persons i-e it will give you a name while labelling other people conversation with easy to tag feature. Now this text is processed by another machine learning model which then extracts based on a template separting into attendes, agenda, main points, milestones, & future meetings which then synced with a calender to set the relevant reminders necessary. All of this, with you focusing on the main stuff acheiving the main agenda rather than organizing stuff.

Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life. 
Describe where your project is, how you could use Google’s help in the endeavor, and how you plan on using On-Device ML technology to bring the concept to life. The best submissions have a great idea combined with a concrete path of where you plan on going, which should include: 
(1) any potential sample code you’ve already written, 
(2) a list of the ways you could use Google’s help, 
(3) as well as the timeline on how you plan on bringing it to life by May 1, 2020.

### About Me

Inquisitive and risk-taker by nature, I have always undertaken projects that are technical, relatable, innovative and fun at the same time. The thing that contributed to the impetus for such a project was that of one of my friends took over an hour to find his car that he parked within a massive mall in Dubai. His recollection gave me an idea for my final year project, that of indoor navigation. In our final year, we fleshed out the concept for such a solution and evaluated several methods. Our team won university award and earned recognition from university-wide professors and industry. Subsequently, I decided to work on this idea further (and commercialize it). I have founded Mapin Co. which can be found at https://www.mapin.app.

Along with understanding the nuances of business, I have been actively developing the technical side ranging from working Backend and Server Side to Mobile application development solely.

There are some of the application which can be found here.

- **MapIn - Indoor Navigation & Deals**

An application to navigate indoors particulary malls. I have designed the backend architecture and developed the application solely. We were successful in incorporating one of the largest mall of Pakistan.

- **MapIn Events**

Building upon the experience of MapIn, I have developed another application in partnership with one of the event organiser.The purpose was to give the event visitors a personal assistant where they get to know about the schedule and can locate and visit different stalls. The application can be found here:

- **Centaurus Mall**

Building upon the experience of MapIn, I have also developed another application in partnership with one of the mall.The purpose was to give the mall visitors a experience where they can get to know about all the relevant deals and offers along with locating and navigating to the particular retails. The application can be found here:

Nowadays, I have started to learn to flutter and I am enjoying it a lot. I am experimenting with web support of flutter and updating my portfolio site in flutter.
